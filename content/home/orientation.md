When you join the group
 Within the first two weeks of joining the group, here is what you should do:

My first name is "Kuldeep" and I would strongly prefer if you use that to address me. 
Ask me to add you to the github organization account (meelgroup)
Create a repository with the following format <last name><first initial>-agenda. This will be your repository for your weekly reports and other administrative stuff such as copies of your CV.  You should have one pdf file for all your weekly reports with the latest week at the top. Please write about one page per week.  
You should create an account at NSCC and NUS HPC (even if you do not intend to work on any experimental papers in near future)
Make sure you have gone through the details about computing cluster at SoC. 
Apply for lab access if you already do not have the lab space assigned to you.  Our Lab is located at  COM2-01-09. 
Update your contact details in this spreadsheet
At the end of the two weeks, send me list of things that I should add to this list. 


Emergency Contact:
In your agenda repository, please leave detail of emergency contacts. Should there be emergency (and I have seen this happen lot of times), it is useful.
When you arrive here, and if you need to provide emergency contact for any purpose (such as to your family), you can give out my information as follows:
                                                        Kuldeep S. Meel

Emergency Fund 
(For group members whose intended stay is >= 1 year)

When I moved to Houston for PhD, I had about $1000$ in my bank account. Thankfully, I had friends in US who could loan me money that I could pay back in couple of months. Since I have faced this issue in the past, I want to make sure you have access to emergency fund even if you do not  know anyone in Singapore. You can ask me for a loan of up to $2500$ whenever you need, and you can pay me back (with 0% interest, i.e. without any interest just in case you were wondering if there is a typo) when you have sufficient money in your account. Do pay me back before leaving Singapore!.
