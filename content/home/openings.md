<p> <font color="red">I am looking for highly motivated Ph.D. students, postdocs, and interns (with time commitment of at least 6 months) in our group.</font> 
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
<li> If you are a student at NUS, feel free to drop by 
my office or schedule a meeting with me. (See <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=meel%40comp.nus.edu.sg" target="_top">my calendar</a>). </li> 
<li>Otherwise, please send me an email with your CV if you are interested.  If you are looking for an internship/postdoc, make sure your subject contains the word "olleh" and you should include reviews of two of my papers (published in the previous 3 years). The reviews should be in the body of the email (and not as pdf). Furthermore, the body of your email should contain the phrase: "Here are two papers that I have reviewed".  A strong background in statistics, algorithms/formal methods and prior experience in coding is crucial to make a significant contribution to our research. 
</ul>
